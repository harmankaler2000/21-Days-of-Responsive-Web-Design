# 21-Days-of-Responsive-Web-Design
 A collection of files that I worked on during the 21 Days of Responsive Web design course by Kevin Powell


This repository contains the files for implementation that I made from the videos and also the containing challenges.


The final challenge has been done from scratch containing two breakpoints for 700px and 1000px.

This course is free  by Kevin Powell(https://github.com/kevin-powell) and helps understand responsive web design using Flexbox.
